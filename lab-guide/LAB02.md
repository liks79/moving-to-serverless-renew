# LAB 02 - Building and deploying your application in HA environment

Before we go to the serverless application architecture, let's deploy our application into the High Availability Applciation Architecture environment to see the obvious differences from the hostbased environment.

So, we'll deploy the CloudAlbum application with HA(high availability) architecture in the Amazon Web Services environment.

## In this lab cover.. 

<img src=./images/lab02-eb-diagram.png width=700>

* Configure [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) for the HA environment. (CloudFormation template will be provided.)
* Configure [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) for the scalable **shared storage**.
* Configure [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) - Redis for the **session store.**
* Configure [ElasticBeanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).
  * with [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [ALB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) and [AutoScaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/). 


## Prerequisites
The following **prerequisited** are required for this hands-on lab:

* AWS Console Access.
* AWS CLI configured EC2 or PC. (***AdministratorAccess*** recommended)


## TASK 1. Create your multi-az VPC

In this section, you will create an VPC with multi-az for the high availability using CloudFormation.

<img src=./images/lab02-task1-cf-diagram.png width=700>


1. Make sure the current region is Singapore (ap-souteeast-1).

    <img src=./images/lab02-task1-region.png width=700>

2. In the AWS Console, click **Services**, then click **CloudFormation** to open the CloudFormation dashboard.

 * CloudFormation new console is available. However, this guide is wrriten for previous console. 
 * If the description of the lab-guide differs from the console screen, select '**switch to the previous console**'.

    <img src=./images/lab02-task1-cf-console.png width=700>

3. Click **Create Stack** button at the top-left corner. (or click **Create new stack** at the center of page.)

4. Download the **CloudFormation** template file (network.yaml) to your local laptop.
 * Download Link : <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-kr-tnc/moving-to-serverless-workshop-1d/master/resources/network.yaml>

5. On the **Select Template** page, click **Upload a template to Amazon S3**. Click **Browse...** button. Then choose ***network.yaml*** file which is downloaded previous step.

6. Click **Next** button.

7. On the **Specify Details** page. Type `workshop-vpc` for **Stack name**. 

8. Review ***Parameters*** section. You can check the CIDR address for VPC and subnets. If you want, you can modify these values your own.

9. Click **Next** button.

10. On the **Options** page, just click **Next** button. 

11. On the **Review** page, click **Create** button. 

12. About 5 minutes later, the stack creation will be completed. Check the **Status** field. You can see that the value of Satus is ***CREATE_COMPLETE***.

    <img src=./images/lab02-task1-cf-complete.png width=700>

13. Explore the ***outputs*** tab. Copy the values of ***outputs*** tab to the your notepad for later use.


## TASK 2. Create EFS

In this section, you will create an EFS for the CloudAlbum application. 

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, elastic file system for Linux-based workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need â€“ when they need it. It is designed to provide massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances, enabling your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS with consistent low latencies. Amazon EFS is a fully managed service that requires no changes to your existing applications and tools, providing access through a standard file system interface for seamless integration.


14. In the AWS Console, click **Services**, then click **EFS** to open the EFS dashboard console.

15. Click **Create file system** button.

16. On the **Configure file system access** page, choose your VPC . You can check the name of VPC, it should contain ***moving-to-serverless***. Then you have to choose pair of **Private subnets** and please check the each Availibity Zone of subnet. 

    <img src=./images/lab02-task2-efs-1.png width=700>

17. Click **Next Step** button. You can refer to following screen capture image.



18. On the **Configure optional settings** page, type `shared-storage` for key **Name** under **Add tags** section.

20. On the **Review and create** page, check the configuration then click **Create File System** button.

21. After a while, you will see that the **Mount target state** changes from **Creating** to **Available** on the **Mount targets** section at the right-bottom corner.

22. If the **Mount target state** becomes **Available**, Copy the **File system ID** and paste it ***notepad*** for later use in TASK 5. 


* Move to the next TASK.


## TASK 3. Create Elasticache 
We'll create Amazon Elasticache - Redis to use as a session store for CloudAlbum application. By storing session data in a separate session store such Elasticache-Redis, we can improve our application from statefull to stateless.

Amazon ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached. Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores. Build data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for Gaming, Ad-Tech, Financial Services, Healthcare, and IoT apps.

23. In the **AWS Managed Console**, on the **Service** menu, Click **ElastiCache**.

24. In the left navigation pane, click **Redis**.

25. Click **Create**.
* This will bring you to the **Create your Amazon ElastiCache cluster** page. **Do not choose** ***Cluster Mode enabled***.

 * **NOTE**: You can click the refresh button in the dashboard, if your cluster status not changed.

## TASK 4. Confiugure ElasticBeanstalk

We will now deploy the CloudAlbum application using ElasticBeanstalk. Our application will be  integrated EFS, Elasticache, RDS, ALB, and AutoScalingGroup via ElasticBeanstalk.

With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

30. In the **AWS Management Console** on the **Service** menu, click **ElasticBeanstalk**.

31. At the top-right of screen, clikck **Create New Application**.

* Find photos with Search tool
* Check the Photo Map


## Options : Investigate the application changes
As you may have recognized, we have added a couple of things to the previous application for this hands-on lab. Here's what we've added:

 * We needed a separate **session-store** for **scale-out** of the application. So, we add a [flask-session](https://github.com/fengsp/flask-session) package. Now, the session data is stored in **Elasticache**'s [Redis](https://redis.io/).

 * We added a **.ebextentions/cloudalbum.config** file for the application deployment.

 * We added **wsgi.py** file for ElasticBeanstalk python preconfigured environment. This file contains the code to store the session-data to Redis.

Let's look a little closer now.

75. Open the `LAB02/CloudAlbum/.ebextensions/cloudalbum.config` file. Take a look at the cloudalbum.config file. We use this file to configure the application. Install the necessary packages, mount EFS, and specify the required environment variables.

```yaml
packages:
  yum:
    amazon-efs-utils : []

files:
  "/app/cloudalbum/efs_setup.sh":
    mode: "000755"
    owner: root
    group: root
    content: |
      #!/bin/bash

      # Commands that will be run on containter_commmands
      # Here the container variables will be visible as environment variables.
      . /opt/elasticbeanstalk/support/envvars

      ## EFS mount
      mkdir -p /mnt/efs
      
      mountpoint /mnt/efs
      
      if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
        echo "Already mounted"
      
      else
        mount -t efs $EFS_ID:/ /mnt/efs
      fi

      chown -R wsgi:wsgi /mnt/efs
      chown -R wsgi:wsgi /app/cloudalbum

container_commands:
  efs_setup:
    command: /app/cloudalbum/efs_setup.sh

option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    LANG: ko_KR.UTF-8
    LC_ALL: ko_KR.UTF-8

  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    WSGIPath: wsgi.py

```


76. We've changed the application source code to ensure that the CloudAlbum application has **High Availability** in the scale-out environment. For this we introduced a **session-store** and decided to use **Elasticache**'s Redis as the session-store. To do this, we added some codes at **wsgi.py** file.

* **wsgi.py** is used to invoke a [WSGI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) application in an ElasticBeanstalk python configured environment. 

* Review following code.


```python

from flask_session import Session

```

* [Flask_Session](https://github.com/fengsp/flask-session) package is imported for using of Redis as an session-store.


```python

# Flask Session for Redis
application.config['SESSION_TYPE'] = 'redis'
application.config['SESSION_REDIS'] = StrictRedis(host=conf['ELCACHE_EP'], port=6379)
Session(application)

```
* Variables set-up to use Elasticache(Redis) as an session-store.
